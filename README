A program showing the power of eclipse e4 context functions and object suppliers.
Called the KnowItAll the program takes a string and based on the contents of the string it goes and fetches the appropriate
service ranging from web service calls to bing translations. Also there are some special injections when someone needs
to use an extended object supplier.
